# winemag-data
Database management group project - fall 2019

Data link: https://www.kaggle.com/christopheiv/winemagdata130k

## In this project, I tried to test 2 hypothesis:

### (1) we can use the origin, price, and ingredient to predict which are good wine

Please see analysis in file "predicting_rating_scores_w_price_origin.ipynb"

Spoiler alert: if did not work well

### (2) wine from different area (in this dataset, I mean province) have different falvors. and we can use text analysis to identify them

Please see analysis in file "lift_analysis.ipynb"

Spoiler alert: this is more interesting
